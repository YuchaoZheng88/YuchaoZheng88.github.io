Normal syn ping do not need root user.  Privileged users (root and sudoers) can send TCP SYN packets and don’t need to complete the TCP 3-way handshake even if the port is open.

TCP SYN scan. nmap -sS {target} need root.UDP Scan  nmap -sU {target} Open: no response. Closed: ICMP destination unreachable.Scope and performance  -F most common 100 ports  -T0 scans one port at a time and waits 5 minutes  -T5 is the most aggressive in terms of speed  -T4 is often used during CTFs  --max-rate 10 or --max-rate=10 ensures that your scanner is not sending more than ten packets per second.  --min-parallelism=512 pushes Nmap to maintain at least 512 probes in parallel  -p- all ports.Nmap Advanced Port ScansNull Scan  sudo nmap -sN 10.10.22.67, all six flag bits are set to zero.                              closed: RST,ACK. open          filtered: no reply.                      need root.FIN Scan  sudo nmap -sF 10.10.22.67, FIN flag set.                              closed: RST,ACK. open          filtered: no reply.                    Xmas Scan  sudo nmap -sX 10.10.22.67, FIN, PSH, and URG flags set.                              closed: RST,ACK. open          filtered: no reply.                    Why:  A stateless firewall will check if the incoming packet has the SYN flag set to detect a connection attempt.  Using a flag combination that does not match the SYN packet makes it possible to deceive the firewall and reach the system behind it.  However, a stateful firewall will practically block all such crafted packets and render this kind of scan useless.TCP Maimon Scan:  sudo nmap -sM 10.10.22.67, FIN and ACK bits are set.  no much use, open and close reply almost same.TCP ACK Scan:  sudo nmap -sA 10.10.22.67, ACK flag set.  can not find if port is open.  this type of scan is more suitable to discover firewall rule sets and configuration.  Result indicates that the firewall is blocking all other ports except for these three ports.Window Scan:  sudo nmap -sW 10.10.22.67, like ACK scan, with more examines the TCP Window field of the RST packets returned.  TCP window scan pointed that three ports are detected as closed.  Although we know that these three ports are closed, we realize they responded differently, indicating that the firewall does not block them.  ACK and window scans are exposing the firewall rules, not the services.Custom Scan:  sudo nmap --scanflags RSTSYNFIN {target}Spoofing and Decoys  nmap -S {SPOOFED_IP} 10.10.121.57  --spoof-mac SPOOFED_MAC This address spoofing is only possible if the attacker and the target machine are on the same Ethernet (802.3) network or same WiFi (802.11).  nmap -D 10.10.0.1,10.10.0.2,RND,RND,ME 10.10.121.57 decoy, hide among other IPs. RND, random IP.Fragmented Packets  A traditional firewall inspects, at least, the IP header and the transport layer header.  A more sophisticated firewall would also try to examine the data carried by the transport layer.  sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144 8 bytes after IP header, in each packet.  sudo nmap -sS -p80 -ff 10.20.30.144 16 bytes after IP header, in each packet.  Nmap splits the packets into eight bytes or less after the IP header. So a 20-byte TCP header would be split into three packets.  The idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder for packet filters, intrusion detection systems, and other annoyances to detect.Idle/Zombie Scan  nmap -sI ZOMBIE_IP 10.10.121.57  This is accomplished by checking the IP identification (IP ID) value in the IP header.More Details  sudo nmap -sS --reason 10.10.252.27 get .  -v for verbose output or -vv for even more verbosity.  -d for debugging details or -dd for even more details.Nmap Post Port ScansOS Detection and Traceroute  sudo nmap -sV 10.10.129.53 Version detection.  sudo nmap -sS -O 10.10.129.53 OS detection.  nmap -sS --traceroute 10.10.129.53 traceroute, Standard traceroute starts with a packet of low TTL (Time to Live) and keeps increasing until it reaches the target.
